<p>Dear Valued Partner/Customer,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for being a valued customer. We are currently initiating a project to simplify how we transact with our customers. The entity you are currently doing business with will change with regards to invoicing and currency. To ensure a seamless transition, we will bill you in &ldquo;NZD&rdquo; and you will pay into a bank that supports that currency. On October 15, 2021, the invoicing will move to INSIGHTSOFTWARE NEW ZEALAND LTD. Attached is banking information and supporting documentation.</p>

<p>We appreciate doing business with you. We are looking forward to serving you in the future. Please feel free to contact us at accounting@insightsoftware.com if you require updated vendor forms or if you have any questions regarding this change, our team will be happy to help.</p>

Best regards,</p>
