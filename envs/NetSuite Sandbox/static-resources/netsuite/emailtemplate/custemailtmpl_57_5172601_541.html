<p>Dear ${customer.companyName},</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for being a valued customer. This letter is to notify you that Global Software LLC, has changed its name to insightsoftware, LLC.  All current invoices and banking information will remain the same.</p>

<p>We are currently initiating a project to simplify how we transact with you. As part of this project, we will move the entity that you are currently invoiced from to our local Australian entity enabling us to bill and collect in AUD. We hope that this future enhancement will result in a smoother and more streamlined process for you.</p>

<p>If you are invoiced by your partner, you will not be impacted by this change.</p>

<p>What happens Next?<br />
On November 16, 2021, our invoicing will move to INSIGHTSOFTWARE, LLC.</p>

<p>Please look for future communications regarding the billing entity change.</p>

<p>We appreciate doing business with you. We are looking forward to serving you in the future. Please feel free to contact us at accounting@insightsoftware.com if you have any questions regarding this change, our team will be happy to help.</p>

<p><br />
Best regards,</p>

<p>insightsoftware Accounts Receivable</p>
