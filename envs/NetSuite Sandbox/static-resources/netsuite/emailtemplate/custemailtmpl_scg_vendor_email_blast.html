<p>Hello insightsoftware vendors,<br />
<br />
Accounts Payable has updated the vendor payment policies and processes. Please see below for details.<br />
<br />
What&rsquo;s new!</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill submission cut-off deadlines</li>
<li>Update to vendor payment timing (around the 7th and the 21st)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why are we changing the process?</p>

<ul>
<li>Every other week payment cadence caused confusion</li>
<li>To improve vendor experience and ensure timely payment</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Key takeaways</p>

<ul>
<li>See the attached 2022 calendar which includes bill submission cut-off dates to ensure timely payments. Any bills received after cut-off will be processed and paid in the following check run. Payment terms apply.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
To facilitate timely payments of your bill(s) please be sure to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit bills to payables@insightsoftware.com by Noon EST on the dates listed on the calendar.</li>
<li>Include the Purchase Order number on your bill
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a Purchase Order, please reach out to your vendor relationship manager to obtain one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure up-to-date tax documentation/information (W9, W8, VAT #, etc.) in on file.
<ul>
<li>If you have not submitted updated tax documentation for 2022, please send your tax documents to purchasing@insightsoftware.com as soon as possible.</li>
