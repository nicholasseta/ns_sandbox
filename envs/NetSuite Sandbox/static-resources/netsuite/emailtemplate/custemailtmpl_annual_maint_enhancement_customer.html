Dear ${customer.companyName},<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s been a big and exciting year for all of us at insightsoftware and we thank you for your continued relationship. In June 2018 we announced that TA Associates acquired Global Software and insightsoftware.com, known to many of you as Hubble, to create insightsoftware and I am honored to be the Chief Executive Officer of the newly combined company. We&rsquo;ve already made several investments which enable us to make rapid progress on our mission to help companies make better use of their financial &amp; operational data to deliver better business outcomes. Our goal is simple: we want our insightsoftware products to deliver a great return on your investment and to become a long-term partner in your business success.<br />
<br />
Our software maintenance and support service is the foundation for our continuing partnership with your organization. It provides access to upgrades, new functionality, support for new technology platforms and, of course, access to our technical support experts. Over the years, program membership helps you to keep pace with leading business and operational best practices and to utilize improvements and new capability that maximizes the value from your investment in insightsoftware products. The following is a summary of investments and preview of initiatives insightsoftware is pursuing to improve every aspect of our service to you.<br />
<br />
<b>Expanded Support and Product Teams</b><br />
<br />
insightsoftware is adding to the value we provide by growing our support team this year by over 30% and our product and engineering team by over 20%. The new additions to Support will allow for faster case response time, diagnosis, and resolution. It also allows us to invest in knowledge articles and videos to give you the ability to access common questions and tips directly. The expansion of engineering will allow us to improve our current products, release new products, and create a more robust roadmap that will offer more capabilities for your users.<br />
<br />
<b>Investments in Training and Development</b><br />
<br />
We recently built an exceptionally thorough and robust training program for our new team members. We&rsquo;re investing in the accelerated development of our new recruits with 9-12 weeks of in-depth industry, technical, and professional training designed to ensure that we deliver consistent quality and performance. We then expand on this with ongoing training and mentorship. We also continue to provide advanced training and development for our experienced team members. Our goal is to improve the information, recommendations, and resolutions we share with you during the support process and deliver product updates that are high quality and highly valuable to you.<br />
<br />
<b>Enhanced Access and Interaction</b><br />
<br />
Along with the ongoing ability to email and call with your questions and support cases, we have made a huge investment in a customer portal that we are rolling out in November and December of 2018. This new portal will provide an online and easy location for you to log cases, share case-related documentation, monitor all cases reported by your company, view progress of product updates, submit surveys, and receive rapid resolution. We&rsquo;ve improved the case submission page with workflows that automatically search our new and expanded knowledgebase, allowing for quick resolution of issues. The new knowledge articles and videos will help you get the most out of your insightsoftware products; fresh article content will be created monthly, based on your feedback and use of the system. And in the coming months, we will be enhancing the collaborative and interactive features of the portal so that you can share enhancement and best practice ideas with us and the great community of insightsoftware customers.<br />
<br />
<b>New Service Offerings</b><br />
<br />
Our Professional Services teams have developed new programs that expand our ability to train your teams in more convenient methods. We recently launched regional training classes in our Denver and Raleigh offices for both Hubble and Global products, making it easier to attend world-class training closer to home. We have also launched and broadened our virtual class offerings, which allow customers to experience the same hands-on attention and interaction of in-person training through a virtual, Webex environment.<br />
<br />
We are excited about the investment and progress we&rsquo;ve made and will continue to make to deliver more value to you.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have a new option available with your renewal. Several customers approached us with concerns raised by substantial jumps in support costs across the software industry, including big increases from several industry leaders. In response, we now offer a 3-year renewal with fixed increases. This means that you have the opportunity to lock in your renewal rates and we can plan ahead and make long-term investments in further product and service enhancements.<br />
<br />
Finally, you will find enclosed a summary of our 2018 product enhancements. We have designed the program with value in mind and our goal is to provide updates that are compelling and that help your organization deliver higher performance at less cost each and every day.<br />
<br />
As always, we appreciate your ongoing partnership. Please contact me at any time if you have any questions or feedback regarding our maintenance and support program.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Mike Lipps
