<p>Dear ${customer.companyName},</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued business and support. We have initiated a project to simplify how we transact with you and as part of this project we have changed the entity who currently invoices you. Future invoices to you will be initiated from our local New Zealand entity enabling us to bill and collect in NZD. This will result in a smoother and more streamlined process for you.<br />
<br />
If you are invoiced by your partner, you will not be impacted by this change.<br />
<br />
Orders billed month-to-month will not be impacted by this change. Please wait for further communications regarding these orders.<br />
<br />
What happens Next?    On November 16, 2021, our invoicing will move to INSIGHTSOFTWARE NEW ZEALAND LIMITED.<br />
